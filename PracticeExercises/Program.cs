             * ------------------------------
             * 
             * 1. Write a C# Sharp program to print the results of the specified operations:

                 -1 + 4 * 6
                 ( 35 + 5 ) % 7
                 14 + -4 * 6 / 11
                2 + 15 / 6 * 1 - 7 % 2
            
                2. Write a C# Sharp program that takes two numbers as input and performs an operation (+,-,*,x,/) on them and displays the result of that operation.

                   Test Data
                   Input first number: 20
                   Input operation: -
                   Input second number: 12
                    Expected Output :
                    20 - 12 = 8

            3. Write a C# Sharp program that takes the radius of a circle as input and calculates the perimeter and area of the circle. 

            4. Write a C# Sharp program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not. 

            5. Write a C# Sharp program to display the cube of an integer up to given number.
                Test Data :
                Input number of terms : 5
                Expected Output :
                Number is : 1 and cube of the 1 is :1
                Number is : 2 and cube of the 2 is :8
                Number is : 3 and cube of the 3 is :27
                Number is : 4 and cube of the 4 is :64
                Number is : 5 and cube of the 5 is :125
